# Multimedia Search
07- Group Project 

## My Task

As a group my taks is to create an interacive front-end appplication that demostrates what we have learned in the past six modules that we will be able to showcase to potential employers. All this while ensuring that use use a CSS framework other than bootstrap. To have the application deployed to GitHub pages and it is interactive. It uses at least two server-side API's. Include at least one modal and does not use native browser aler, confrim, or prompt functionality. Ues client-side sotarge to store persistent data and it is responsive.
